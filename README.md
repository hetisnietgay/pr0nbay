Everything is configurable, but I'm still working on the settings UI (did I mention I fucking hate javascript?) - the code is there and close. Once it's done I'll upload this bad boy to sleazyfork, but I wanted to give the community a peek at what I'm working on. That way folks can flame me and/or request features in the mean time.

With that being said: if you don't understand how to use this script, then the bottom line is just wait until the settings UI is finished.

This early drop is for the certified computer wiz kids.

To change your configuration without the UI, use violentmonkey, there is a "values" section in their UI.
